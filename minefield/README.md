A tool to create random problems with a unique solution.

For advanced users only. If you already know how to build this thing just by looking at the list of filenames in this directory, great, get to it, and you'll need the Haskell library provided in the `haskell` directory of [this repo](https://github.com/dmwit/maryodel); but if you don't already know how to build it, well, it's complicated enough that I don't fancy explaining it.
